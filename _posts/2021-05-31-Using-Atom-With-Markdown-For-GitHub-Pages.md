![github-atom-markdown](/images/github-atom-markdown.png)

Atom is a phenomenal free code editor. The plethora of extentions for it makes it a real pleasure to play with and experiment. Among it many many features that I am still finding out after using it for a the better part of the year, is its capability to handle Markdown. After using many platforms and editors for my blog needs, I found the combination of GitHub, Atom and Markdown the best suited for me. Lightwight, geeky and trmendously simple and it makes me somehow feel like I am still coding and not really wrting a blog post. But thats just me.

###### So what exactly is Atom ?

Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell),a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.
